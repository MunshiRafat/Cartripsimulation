# Cartripsimulation
Car trip simulation System is a web based application built with javascript and google maps API for users to find directions and simulate his/her car’s movement on the screen. Zoom in and zoom out options are available to have a view of the proximity areas of the car with various zooming levels. An option to increase or decrease the speed of the car is also given for better functionality of the application.

1.	The user enters the address of the two locations between which he/she wants to find directions.
2.	The system displays a map with the best direction from the source to the destination address with proper markers.
3.	A car icon is showed to travel from the source to the destination at a predefined speed. The car changes direction to show which direction to go ahead
4.	As the car moves, the instructions for travelling ahead are displayed.
5.	Once the car reaches its destination, the animation stops and a message is displayed –“Trip completed”.
6.	The user is provided with a plus and minus symbol on the map to change zoom levels.
7.	On reaching the end of the screen of the car icon, the next part of the map should be loaded with the car icon at the center of the screen. Thus the whole path map should be loaded part by part based on the completion of the traversal of the car icon on the screen.
8.	The user should be able to increase or decrease the speed of the car and based upon that speed, the animation of the car fastens or slows down. The car icon should be covering the distance in that exact time which is calculated based on the current speed.
